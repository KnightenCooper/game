PROGRAM
----------
The program we are going to create is a dodging game 
game where the user has control over a fat guy
and there are vertical scrolling healthy and unhealthy 
that the guy can choose to either dodge or eat. If user 
eats unhealthy food he grows and if he eats healthy food he 
shrinks. There is a countdown timer where the user wins when
the timer hits 0.

TECHNOLOGY
----------
We are going to use Python, the Arcade Library and sprites 
potentially using the kenney.nl library.
